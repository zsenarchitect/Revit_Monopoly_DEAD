- UI window
- when moving piece, aware if there is a nother player in the target step spot, if so, update the tarpet point higher so visually it jump over, however, if it is the finial desitation, then use shift piece method above. note: consider overweight and stop.

  *demolistion

improvement:
- orientation with piece_model
- separate the main script to smaller piece
- reduce agent class to Get/Set_para_name method, eliminate \
  the class property other than self.model
- dont need to use "__asset"/"_property" prefix?
- FOR 2.0: position id changed from integer to str so locations like hospotal can be searchable insetad of predefined
- no class agent? maybe just a seperate lib script?----NO, just put whole class on a lib file
- list important global marker id:
  hospital = -100
  prision = -200
  starter = -50
- def marker class with all the method
